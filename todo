Was working on animation hookups for entity states/movements. I figured I'd get running animations + camera movement working, then move on to physics.

What I was stuck on was: 

-Does an animationcontroller set a model to it's expected animation every frame, or poll for change and set it once?
-To have dynamic speed on walk/run/other anims, animatonTargets may need access to the current animation + settings being used by the animator for them. Might take a restructure of the animation system.
