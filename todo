        Dev console is up, that should be enough for now. Gonna hold off on UI on second though.
        Demo comes first, it's time to get some mechanics in here:
                Enemies
                Taking damage/death
                Finalizing phys feel.
                Attacks, hitboxes, weapons?
                Picking up projectiles, entities.
                Bounces, Dashes, Knockback
                VFX + Juice
