From Todo -> Enemies

Step 1: Load entity into scene
On loading levels/scenes.

    Level files (.lvl) are loaded at the level-object scope. How are entities supposed to be loaded? 
    It would make sense to have multiple entity "layers" determined by savefile state. Like Goron City.
    Does this game have a save? Is it a server-side state? I think yes and yes.

    We need a system for associating level.json files with the correct (if multiple) entity layers.
    entity.json with multiple layer entries?

    Also, they're json files, you probably should just leave their filenames like that.

    Step 1.A: Separating game into client-server.
    >First, we need a MAIN MENU to launch the server thread and connect to it. (Done)
    >Next, we need our server to load a Level and Layer depending on a Savefile.


    >Finally, our client needs to connect to the server, and recieve the Levelfile (URL) and each Entity in play.
